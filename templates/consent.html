                        <b>Background on the research study:</b> My name is Brian Nieves and I am undergraduate student at Duke University conducting a research study with the assistance and oversight of R. Alison Adcock, M.D., Ph.D., of the Departments of Psychology & Neuroscience and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences and Kathryn Dickerson, Ph.D., of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at Duke University. The goal of this study is to use mouse tracking technology to gain a better understanding of the link between motivation, information-seeking, and decision making.

                        <b>What you will be asked to do:</b> If you choose to participate in this study, you will be using a modified mouse cursor in order to select from potential rewards by clicking on areas of the screen. The movement and position of this cursor will be tracked throughout the experiment. Your normal cursor will be hidden for the duration of the experiment. It must remain hidden for the whole experiment for you to complete the experiment. You will also be given the opportunity to quickly and repeatedly press a button on your keyboard at some points during the experiment. You will first complete a practice session that takes approximately 5 minutes. The main task will take approximately 20-30 minutes, including intermittent breaks. Each trial will continue after 5 seconds or as soon as you make a selection, and each selection in the main task can add between $0.01 and $1.00 to your bonus. Ten trials will be randomly selected to add to your bonus after the experiment is complete. The bonus can range from $0-$10.00. After you complete the trials, you will be asked to complete three short questionnaires. They will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. As such, you are free to withdraw your consent and end the experiment at any time by exiting from the page. However, your HIT will only be received by us after completing all trials and questionnaires. If you exit the experiment before completing all trials and questionnaires, please return the HIT so that another worker may participate. The base payment is $0.50, in addition to any bonus you accrue. The total payment thus ranges from $0.50-$10.50. However, any bonus accumulated by you will not be received if you end the experiment early. By clicking “continue” below, you are implicitly giving your consent to participate in this experiment. If you do not consent, please exit this page and return this HIT.

                        <b>Confidentiality:</b> If you choose to participate, we will receive your Worker ID, which we will use to distinguish your data from that of other participants. We will also receive your I.P. address to keep track of the geographical demographics of participants. We will not receive or record your name or email address.

                        <b>Benefits and Risks:</b> We do not anticipate any personal benefits or risks associated with participation in this study.
