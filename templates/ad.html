<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <p>
									The Motivated Memory Lab at Duke University is looking for online participants for
									a brief psychology experiment. The requirements are that you are between 18-45 years
									old (inclusive) and a fluent English speaker who resides in the United States. The task will take approximately 40
									minutes and will pay up to $10.50 upon completion, depending on your performance.
									The task will consist of a computer game and two written questionnaires. For each
									trial in the game, you will be asked to move a modified computer mouse cursor to
									select between multiple monetary rewards.
							    </p>
							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the 
									HIT so someone else can participate.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>
							    

							{% else %}

								<!-- 
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit. 
									You should thus show them instructions to begin the 
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
