            In this experiment, you will be playing a game that involves moving your mouse cursor to a target area in order to receive a reward. We estimate the entire experiment will take you about 50 minutes to complete, including filling out questionnaires. The game itself is estimated to take about 25 minutes. During the game, you will have breaks where you can rest and begin again when you are ready.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please refer to the image below for the structure of the experiment. Details will be given on the next two pages.

            In the game there are two stages with 16 and 175 trials each. At the beginning of each trial, the cursor will start at the bottom of the screen. Each trial ends either the moment you click on a reward area, or after 5 seconds have elapsed. Trials start automatically, so please be prepared to do the next trial immediately after you complete a trial. You will be able to take breaks at designated points in the experiment. Specifically, they will occur after 8 trials in stage 1 and after every 25 trials in stage 2.  You can rest for as long as you like during each break, although it is recommended that you complete the experiment in one sitting. The first stage consists of 16 practice trials to become familiar with the game (practice session). You must complete the practice trials in order to move on to stage 2 of the experiment. After you complete both the practice stage and main stage, you will be asked to complete two questionnaires, and then the experiment will be complete. On the next two pages, the details of the experiment will be described.
        </p>ote there are two types of jQuery's each, the one iterates over and returns jQuery objects, the other is a more generic version.
