            There are three types of trials in the game. Before each trial begins, a label will appear indicating the type of upcoming trial. The types of trials are "Single", "Double", and "Press", and each is described below. In all trials, the brighter the reward region, the more valuable it is. Reward values range between $0.01 and $1.00, with $1.00 being the brightest. You will be told what the exact value of your selection is immediately after clicking on it (for example, $0.75).
        </p>

        <p>While Single and Double trials start automatically, Press trials give you two seconds to press the <b>spacebar key</b> if you would like to keep the colors on the reward regions. Otherwise, they will both be the same shade of gray. The number of presses required is random.</p>

                <h4>Single Trials</h4>

                <p>In these trials, there will only be one reward region on the screen. The color of the reward area will be a variety of shades of blue (darkest=low reward, brightest=high reward). You may move your mouse cursor to select a target area as soon as the trial begins.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Double Trials</h4>

                <p>
                    In these trials, there will be two reward regions on opposite corners of the screen. Their colors will be shades of red (darkest=low reward, brightest=high reward). You may move your mouse cursor to click on either reward region as soon as the trial begins.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Press Trials</h4>

                <p>
                    In these trials, the two reward regions are an identical shade of grey. These trials do not give any information about their reward value. You will have the opportunity to reveal the value of the reward regions, if you so choose, by performing an additional task prior to the trial. This task gives you two seconds to press the spacebar key <b>as many times as you can</b>. Each trial has a random threshold of presses. If you press the spacebar enough times (beyond the threshold), the colors of the reward regions in the upcoming trial will be revealed (red; darkest=low reward, brightest=high reward). You will not be told what the threshold is for each trial. The two seconds start immediately after the "Press" message that reveals what type of trial is next. The trial will immediately start two seconds later, regardless of whether you choose to press the spacebar or not, so be prepared. You may move your mouse cursor to click on either reward region as soon as the trial begins.

        <p>Below is a labelled trial that could arise from either a Double trial or a Press trial where reward values (colors) have been revealed.</p>
